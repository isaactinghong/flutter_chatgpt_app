# Simple Flutter Version ChatGPT 

Created by Chenran(cn257@cornell.edu)

This is a simple version of chatgpt in flutter, using your own API key. With this app, you can chat in app with chatgpt. I never learned flutter before, but with ChatGPT, I created this simple version in 2 days! You can build this too!

There may be some bugs though, bare with me.
